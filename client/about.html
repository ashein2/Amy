	<h3>About Us</h3>
	<p> The practice log book is an easy way to keep track of your swim practices and track your performance from season to season. It will have every set and practice logged and you can see your improvement in yardage and a decrease in interval. You will be able to speak into the app, which will make practice making much quicker. You will also be able to easily share the practice with other coaches and swimmers, so that they can have a record of it. It will also take away the need for paper copies being printed and thrown away after 3 hours, since you will be able to follow the entire practice straight from the app.</p>
